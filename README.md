An expression graphing calculator built using JavaFX. Supports a wide variety of operations such as:
`x=-3*5/floor(5)^-(2*3)`

The list of operations include:
* Standard arithmetic, trignometric
* Bitwise operations
* Math functions i.e. absolute value, floor, ceil
* Variables

Expression precedence is done through an implementation of the [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm).
No libraries/external functions were used except for building the UI.

The UI is built using JavaFX, FXML, and CSS.

#### TODO
Create a runtime image for easy use.
